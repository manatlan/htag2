# Production Deployment

While runners are great for development and desktop apps, `htag` applications are fully compatible with production-grade web servers.

## Starlette Integration

Every `Tag.App` in `htag` exposes an underlying **Starlette** instance through its `.app` property. This allows you to deploy your application using standard tools like `uvicorn` or `gunicorn`.

### Basic Production Entrypoint

```python
# app.py
from htag import Tag

class MyApp(Tag.App):
    def init(self):
        self <= Tag.h1("Production App")

# Create the Starlette instance
app = MyApp().app
```

You can now run this with `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```

## Embedding htag in existing Starlette/FastAPI apps

Since `htag` uses a `WebServer` wrapper, you can also mount it as a sub-application or include its routes in a larger Starlette or FastAPI project.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from htag.server import WebServer
from my_htag_app import MyApp

main_app = Starlette()

# Wrap your htag App in a WebServer
htag_server = WebServer(MyApp)

# Mount or include routes
main_app.mount("/htag", htag_server.app)

@main_app.route("/health")
def health(request):
    return JSONResponse({"status": "ok"})
```

## Performance & Scalability

- **WebSockets**: Ensure your production load balancer (like Nginx or Traefik) is configured to handle WebSocket connections properly.
- **Workers**: Since `htag` maintains session state in memory (by default), you should ideally use **sticky sessions** if you scale to multiple worker processes or containers.
- **Memory**: Each active session consumes a small amount of memory on the server. Monitor your memory usage if you expect thousands of concurrent users.
